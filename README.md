### Business Understanding 
This market company wants to analyze market segmentation, where consumers are interested in that market in buying a product. This refers to Consumer Behavior, where what we get in the analysis later is what type of consumer is interested in this product or this market? What is the relationship between one variable and other variables? What is the condition of consumers when buying in the market based on their income? and others.
Goals: This campaign can aim to introduce new products, remind consumers of existing products, or encourage customer loyalty by providing special offers or discounts.

#### What will you do ?
Our/company's step in this analysis is to carry out **hypothesis testing** to find out whether there is a statistically significant relationship between education and income. Apart from that, there are also relevant visualizations related to the analysis.

                              Output/Result: Value of Hypothesis Testing and answer of that statements.
